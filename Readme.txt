This Project was very fun to work on,
i decided to showcase the hash function,
since it has a "fixed" size display,
as opposed to a tree, and it is in a
way challenging to implement a Graphical
visualization for.
To implement a display which involves
animation showing each step of the Hash
Table insertion and deletion operations,
an animation stack had to be used, such that
the animation is carried out one by one,after
initially pushed onto the stack, during the
actual operations.
I implemented Linear probing, Quadratic probing
and Double hashing as Collision resolution
methods. Universal hashing was not implemented
due to the uncertainty over the set of Universe
of which the keys will be drawn on.
Further development could be made to showcase
an algorithm to find universal hash functions,
given a selection of a Universe.
